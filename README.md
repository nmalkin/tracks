Tracks, a GPX viewer
====================
Tracks is a web application that displays a GPX file on a map.

It's static, so it doesn't require any setup: just open the index file in your browser, and you're all set to go.

The GPX file will be read from your local filesystem: you can drag it in or click to load it.

The application uses [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) to display the data over [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/).
